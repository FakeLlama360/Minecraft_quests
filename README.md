# For Commitors
## Rewriting your minecraft modpack folder
firstly look if someone has made changes in repository, we are going to work on different quests and quest groups simulaniosly, so that means you as contributor only put your newly finnished thing from your minecraft modpack to this repository, I'll gladly help you my Discord ==> "fantom_360". You can write me there and ask about the files. You will mainly update the file named: "chapter_groups.snbt" and add files to: "chapter" folder. 

the same other way around, bc it would be better to work will full quest bc you can do something with the "chapter_groups.snbt" and the consequences would be damaging for the project, so when someone add new thing to "chapter_groups.snbt" file please replace it in your modpack + add the new files in "chapter" folder.
